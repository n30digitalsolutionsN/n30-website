## 🎤 ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)

### Version 1 - Short & Sweet:
"I'm [Your Name] with N30 Digital Solutions. We help local Lae businesses get online affordably. Most people don't realize that 80% of customers search online before buying - if you're not there, they go to competitors. We solve that with professional websites starting at K299."

### Version 2 - With Social Proof:
"We're a startup agency helping Lae businesses go digital. We just finished an amazing project with Butibam Mantics - they now have a professional website with team registration, an admin dashboard, and they're ranked in local search. We can do the same for your business affordably."

### Version 3 - Problem/Solution:
"A lot of local businesses think getting a website costs K10,000+. We proved that's not true. Our Butibam Mantics website was professional-grade at a fraction of that cost. If you want to be found online without breaking the bank, we're the agency for you."

## 🎯 RESPONSE TO COMMON OBJECTIONS

## 🌟 STORY TO TELL: BUTIBAM MANTICS

Use this narrative in every pitch:

"Let me tell you about our first major client - Butibam Mantics Rugby Club. They're a local rugby team in Lae, and they had a problem: no way to register players online, no digital presence, couldn't communicate with supporters.

We built them a modern website with:
- Beautiful design that represents their brand
- Team registration forms
- Admin dashboard to manage everything
- Database integration  
- SEO optimization so people can find them

The result? They went from completely invisible online to having a professional platform. Now they can operate more efficiently, engage their community, and grow.

That's exactly what we can do for your business."

Your advantage:
- ✅ Local understanding
- ✅ Lean operation (low cost)
- ✅ Startup pricing for startup clients
- ✅ Personal service
- ✅ Proven track record (Butibam Mantics)

## 📌 FINAL REMINDER

**The best selling tool is authenticity.**

Don't memorize these scripts word-for-word. Use them as guides, but:
- Speak naturally
- Show genuine interest in their business
- Listen more than you talk
- Ask questions
- Let them tell their story
- Only pitch when you understand their needs

**Success = Understanding customer needs + Showing how you solve them**

Not success = Pitching your services regardless of their needs.
